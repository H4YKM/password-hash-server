# password-hash-server

It is a simple <strong>POST</strong> server that uses the standard HTTP library, and the optional <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-hash">OBJECT-HASH</a> library.
The server gets your password from a regular HTML page and will make a hashed password out of it.
It will be difficult to crack. You can see the result on console.

## First step

```javascript
npm instal
```
